GOAL1 2 3.14159     <DOF>       <setpoint>

Good for depth and heading goals.

SAMPLE 0 13 900

pump sampler unit 0, cartridge 13 for 15 minutes
N.B. DEPTH_OFFSET is a command that currently only works via acoustic communication, but not in the mission script.

- three axes with positive pointing forward, starboard, keelward
- three angles with right-handed chirality on each of those axes (sometimes known as nautical angles)
  - internally we use quaternions to represent orientation, but Dana extracts heading and closes the loop in that plane only

With C/C++ arrays beginning at index 0, this means:

- 0: forward
- 1: vehicleâ€™s right
- 2: down (if vehicle is level)
- 3: roll
- 4: pitch
- 5: yaw

For mesobot, we primarily control DOF 0, 2, 5.
